Predicting House Prices using Neural Networks 

By: Aadit Gupta and Dalton Cymbalski

Description: This project uses an advanced neural netork model to predict house prices from housing markets all over the country. Using a housing dataset from kaggle that includes 5000 variables with features such as average area income, average area house age, average area number of rooms, and area population. 

Key aspects of the project included:
data preprocessing, development of our model, and evaluation and optimization techniques.
